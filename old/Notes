Notes
-----

To do:

- fontsize dependent of screensize
- draw axes numbers in a smarter way; like OnPaint does with animation values;
make a single function out of it (for conversion double to CString)
- speed optimization?
- smarter axes separation
- titlebar icon
- axes numbers alignment
- check whether the following is the case: if you set limitN to slightly less than Nmax, or in words, set it to something that cannot be a simple multiple, do you not go beyond Nmax?

Known bugs:

* value of N was 10450928 or something like that after escaping the calculation (N initially
was 9999999999999999999999999999999999 or so).
* suppose Nmax = 100, limitN = 10 and neglectN = 90: points will appear (10 points);
now suppose neglectN = 91: no points appear, it seems we do one cycle too few.
* not well defined: program sometimes refuses to draw axes; is accompanied by another
program (Asus Probe on my home computer) giving error messages ("Canvas does not allow").
Restarting program helps. Seems you mustn't wait too long before restarting the program;
I had it crash my computer once.

Ideas:

- isn't there a standard (OLE/Activex) object for pictures which I could use for storing
my picture. Hopefully it'll handle all the repainting jobs
- a second 'mode' where the dots are bigger, are drawn very slowly. This would illustrate
the chaotic nature; the sensitive dependence of the trajectory onto the starting conditions.
User should be able to set the first coordinate.
- multi-threading: instead of breaking the painting job off regularly to let the program
be able to do other things, it would perhaps be wiser to create a program in a program
- allocate orbit into memory (restrictions on number of points) for fast zooming: lots of
problems can be foreseen for the implementation. Basic approach would be to make a separate
class for points and another for storing them in memory (or file even?).
- put calculations in separate background thread (see CRuntimeClass/RUNTIME_CLASS and
AfxBeginThread).
- loop animation toggle
- another demo, closely related to demo 3 (call it 3a and b):
a=1.1455; b=0.4;Nmax=20000;#iterates=10000;#first=1000;incr=5e-005;range=0.004;xleft=-1.5;
xright=1.8;ytop=0.7;ybottom=-0.7;whole_orbit=true;line orbit=false;clean orbit=true
shows periodic window (period-8) which period-doubles back to attractor, but if you enable
whole orbit you can see that points travel along the ghost of the attractor before reaching
periodic points (these grow to white patches)
- 'f' key for full screen - disabling status and toolbar
- reset_window_dimensions during animation and/or on every OnPaint (in the last case, give limitN a boost)
