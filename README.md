Hénon
=====

A Python program for exploring the Hénon attractor. For an explanation of what the Hénon attractor is please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9non_map">Wikipedia</a>.

<b>How to use the program</b>

With this program you can draw the Hénon attractor and interact with it in various ways. You can currently only zoom in by selecting an area, but later you will be able to change the Henon parameters and make animations with them. Several demonstrations will be included.

<b>Sidenote</b>

This program is a re-implementation of an old Visual C++ program. The installer of that program is still functional up until Windows 7 at least. The old installer is available as the first release.
